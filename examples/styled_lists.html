                    Lists can be nested within one another, and if the text wraps to a new line, the padding for the bullet/numbering will still apply to the new line.

                        The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip did.

                            <li>
                                He had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It was going to rain, so he better get outside and prepare.

                                        Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things don't work out as planned.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        This had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                    <li>
                        He didn't actually enjoy it, but he had accepted it and come to terms with it. Or at least he thought he had.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All that changed when he put the key into the ignition, turned it and the engine didn't make a sound.
